-- ULTIMATE FIX: Don't rely on is_admin() function
-- Use ONLY direct role check in policies
-- This is the most reliable approach

-- Step 1: Ensure user_profiles policy allows reading own profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Step 2: Update departments policies to ONLY use direct check
-- Remove dependency on is_admin() function entirely
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all departments" ON departments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can create departments" ON departments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update departments" ON departments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete departments" ON departments;

-- Use ONLY direct EXISTS check - no function dependency
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all departments"
  ON departments FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM user_profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'::UUID
        AND is_active = true
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can create departments"
  ON departments FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM user_profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'::UUID
        AND is_active = true
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can update departments"
  ON departments FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM user_profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'::UUID
        AND is_active = true
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete departments"
  ON departments FOR DELETE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM user_profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'::UUID
        AND is_active = true
    )
